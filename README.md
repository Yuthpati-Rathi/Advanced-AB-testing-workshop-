# Advanced A/B Testing Workshop



## Workshop description
There is nothing better than a head-to-head A/B test to drive marketing decisions.  A/B tests lead to simple analytics that almost everyone in the organization can understand and act on. If you’ve run at least a few A/B tests, this workshop will show you how to use more powerful analytics tools like predictive modeling to get more insight out of your tests. After reviewing the basics of A/B test analysis, we will talk about testing strategies you can use when you have a very large or very small sample sizes. We will cover a pile of advanced techniques including heterogeneous treatment effects, uplift modeling, causal forests, blocking, matching, and post-stratification. If this sound like a bunch of jargon to you right now, that’s okay. I will demystify the jargon and help you understand when and why you might use these techniques in analyzing your A/B tests. We will also cover profit-maximizing Bayesian approaches to A/B testing including test & roll and multi-armed bandits. 

## Workshop outline

    - Sample size planning
3. [When your sample size is big](https://eleafeit.github.io/ab_test/code/3_large_sample.html)
    - Slice and dice 
    - Uplift modeling
    - Causal forests
4. [When your sample size is small](https://eleafeit.github.io/ab_test/code/4_small_sample.html)
    - Post-stratification
    - Pre-test matching
5. [Maximizing profits](https://eleafeit.github.io/ab_test/code/5_profit_max.html)

### Take aways
- How do you get more out of your A/B tests when your sample sizes are really big or way too small? 
- Can I get more lift by deploying my marketing to the right customers or stores? 
- How do “classical” and Bayesian approaches to A/B testing differ?
